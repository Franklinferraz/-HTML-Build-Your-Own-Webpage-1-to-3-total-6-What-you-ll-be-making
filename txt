1.What you'll be making
Before we ask you to write a bunch of code, we think it's helpful for you to see exactly what you'll be making in this project.

Check out the index.html file and the Result tab for an exampleâ€”we've made our very own webpage.

Instructions
Hit Save & Submit Code to start building your own!

2.Every house needs a frame
An HTML page is sort of like a house: it needs a certain number of essential structures in order to work.

Just like a house, an HTML page needs a frame. In this case, your frame is made of <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

Instructions
Your webpage is blank as the day it was born! Let's add five things:

The <!DOCTYPE> tag
Your <html> tags
Your <head> tags
<title> tags (with any title you like!) between your head tags
Your <body> tags
?
Hint
Feel free to look back at HTML Basics if you get stuck.

3.It's better with a header
Your webpage could use an <h1> header between the body tags to let everyone know that the page is about you.

Instructions
Create an <h1> tag inside your body tags. Between your opening <h1> and closing </h1> tags, type your name for all to see!
